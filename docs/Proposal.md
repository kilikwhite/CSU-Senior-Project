Problem Statement:
------------------

Programming competitions are a major event for computer programmers to show off
their practiced skills. There are many practice methods for one person, which
are available everywhere. However, the process of training for programming
competitions is tough without another person to directly help to practice.
Fortunately, the limited amount of group practice for programming competitions
can be solved by a program that allows the programmer to compete against another
person online simultaneously.

The program is going to function similarly to a program called Hackerrank which
is an important source for practicing for programming competitions. This program
will allow multiple students to practice online against other people to hone
their programming skills for programming competitions and make group practice
possible from the other personâ€™s own home. It will also generate a lot more
interest in programmers because of the game aspect of the program which will
lead to more programmers that are not interested in the programming competitions
becoming either more interested in competitions or become more skilled at
programming. Overall, the program will fix the issue of programmers being unable
to practice in groups for programming competitions.

Project Description:
--------------------

The project mainly addresses the lack of being able to practice for a
programming competition by making something that can allow practice
simultaneously. This project is going to be similar to Hackerank in terms of
checking the program and seeing if it passes the test cases except it is going
to be two people competing to see who can figure out the solution faster. The
goal will be approached by making an IDE compiler, then making an open
connection to the server, and, after that, adding more features over time.  
The main language the program is going to support javascript mainly.  

The two people will compete on this site by first one making a room for the other 
person to join.  The room being made has two different options, one is Spectator 
only which is a room where all the maker can do is observe the programming that 
is being done by the other people.  The second option is Participant room maker, 
this allows the person to participate and they act like a participant meaning they 
can not see the other person's code when participating and they can change to 
Spectator only at any time but lose the ability to actively participate.   The 
people will know how well they are doing by hitting the Run button to run the code 
and they will see text that said passed X number of tests.  There 
is also participant only where all the person needs to enter a room in the room code 
of an already made room to start programming against each other.

Proposed Implementation Languages:
----------------------------------

Javascript

Libraries, Packages, Development Kits, etc. to be used in the proposed implementation languages(s):
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Express.js, Ace Editor, React, Socket.io, npm Sandbox, npm react-timer-hook, and Axios 

Additional Software/Equipment Needed:
-------------------------------------

Visual Studio Code

Personal Motivation:
--------------------

Completing a project like this will not only help expand my experience since
this would be the first project I do myself.  It will also improve my knowledge
of networking even further since it will require connections between two hosts.
This type of project was spicifically chosen because I was curious about how 
online games were made connection wise so this project will help show me 
how online components are fully programed.  Another motivation is the fact of 
fully learning javascript because this is one of the languages that I don't fully 
know yet I heard that, javascript is a really diverse language which can do 
networking capabilities so this works out for the project.  

Outline of Future Research Efforts:
-----------------------------------

I will see all that Meteor.js has to offer via doing the online tutorials. Then
I may have to research how to make a programming IDE with javascript as a base.
After the javascript IDE is done then there will be more research on how to
connect to other clients for communication.  The Challenges I expect to face will 
mainly be towards the networking end of the project since it is going to be complex 
instead of just making and IDE. So Most of my reasearch will mostly be in Networking.
