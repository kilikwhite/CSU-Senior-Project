7. Challenges Overcome
   > The challenges that I have overcome was essentially having to restart development 
   > since I was having trouble with Meteor JS.  Then it was the research with how to 
   > have react ace in the project along with more on socket programing.  Finally, it was 
   > finding the time to program this in general with the busy school year.
   
8.  Future Enhancements
   > I plan on trying to add more questions on the program for both practice and the main program 
   > eventually.  I also plan on slowly improving the senior project through minor fixes and 
   > visual updates.  I also thought about adding C++ and python to the possible languages that can be used with the program.
