Programming competitions are a major event for computer programmers to show off their practiced skills. 
There are many practice methods for one person, which are available everywhere. However, the process of 
training for programming competitions is tough without another person to directly help to practice. Fortunately,
group practice for programming competitions can be done with this program along with general practice.

The program functions similarly to a program called HackerRank.  Where it differs is that the program adds a 
shared experience with other people through an online component.  Because of the online component, this program 
will allow multiple students to practice against other people to hone their programming skills for programming 
competitions and make group practice more possible. It will also generate a lot more interest in programmers 
because of the spectator aspect of the program.  It will lead to more programmers that are not interested 
in the programming competitions becoming either more interested in competitions because of the game aspect or 
become more skilled at programming. Overall, the program will fix the issue of poor group practice avenues and 
allow programmers a new avenue to practice in groups for programming competitions.
