Now to describe some of the things that are inside of the project in terms of implementation.  First 
is the homepage which is represented by figure # 1.

In the Practice Page, there is an area for code and a run button.  If the code is entered and the run button
is pressed then you will get something like figure # 3 where it shows the expected output and the actual output.

Next is more on figure # 4, the figure has two text fields and a checkbox on if the person wants to be a 
spectator or participant.  The first textbox will be your username that the user is going to use for the 
process and the second textbox will be used for socket-io to connect with the other person. 

Figures #5, #6, and #7 shows all of the textboxes with the fields full with #7 being a setup for the spectator 
room.  After the send button is pressed then it will send the user to the specific rooms.

You can also press the "Share Code" button and what it will do is the code will be sent to everyone in the room.  
As for the Spectator portion of the program, the spectator has a chat box where they can send whatever they want 
to the chat along with a stopwatch so they can count how long the entire session is when they first joined.
