**Plan**
The people that are going to test this are both myself and my mother.  
We will both get the actual results by both my motherâ€™s feedback and my feedback.

As for the test platform, I tested it both on my laptop and my desktop.  
More of the testing details are inside of the test specification document.
I used the test cases as a guide for this section to make sure that the program will work.

**Results**
The program ended up passing roughly 85% of the tests both between me and my mother.  
The majority of the reasons some of the tests failed is either because of the changes in production or 
the differences from the initial test.
